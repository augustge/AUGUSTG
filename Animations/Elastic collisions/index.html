      <h1>Colliding Blocks</h1>
      This is a simulation of elastically colliding blocks inspired by a <a href="https://youtu.be/HEfHFsfGXjs">3Blue1Brown video on YouTube</a>
      about the connection between the number of collisions and $\pi$.
      During collisions between blocks, both energy
      \[
        E = \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 v_2^2
      \]
      and momentum
      \[
        P = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2
      \]
      is conserved. However, the blocks can also collide with the wall, which corresponds to $v \mapsto -v$. This
      changes overall the momentum, but not the energy.  In particular, if we rescale the axes, then the energy
      condition requires the points $\left(\sqrt{m_1}v_1,\sqrt{m_2}v_2\right)$ will lie on a circle of
      radius $\sqrt{2E}$. Likewise, the momentum condition requires points to lie on a straight line with
      slope $\sqrt{m_1}/\sqrt{m_2}$. In other words, the angle subtended by a collision point in phase space is
      \[
        \theta = \arctan \sqrt{\frac{m_1}{m_2}}.
      \]
      This corresponds to angle $\gamma=2\theta$ as seen from the center of the energy-conservation circle. Therefore,
      If there is only one wall, the maximal number of collisions $N$ before the two blocks part their ways is the
      largest integer such that $N\gamma < 2\pi$. That is
      \[
        N
        = \Bigg\lfloor \frac{\pi}{\arctan \sqrt{m_1/m_2}} \Bigg\rfloor
        \simeq
        \Big\lfloor \pi \sqrt{\frac{m_2}{m_1}} \Big\rfloor,
      \]
      where, in the last approxiamtion, the arc tangent has been expanded around $m_1/m_2 = 0$ to linear order.
      This means that if $m_2 = 10^{2n}m_1$, then the number of collisions will be the floor of $\pi 10^n$. For example,
      $m_2=100m_1$ means we expect $N=31$ collisions, and for $m_2=10^8m_1$ we expect $N=31415$ collisions. These are
      the first $4=8/2$ digits of $\pi\simeq 3.14159265358979...$
