        Well... I came across <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/artl.2010.16.2.16202">this</a>
        article the other day, and found it fascinating.
        In it, a simple numerical method based on chem-trails and chemoattraction of simple organisms is shown to reproduce complex patterns.
        Without going into much detail, I decided to play with the idea here. After playing a bit with it, it turned out to give very pretty results, so I decided to
        make it into a automatic-art thing. 
        <p>
        My approach was the following: I crate an object, called a <i>walker</i> (create with mouseclick), whose main properties is a position, a direction, and a color $\mathbf{c}_0$ (or rule).
        Each step, a walker walks toward its direction at a preset, but somewhat fluctuating, length. After moving, it interacts with a background color mesh, either
        by smearing nearby pixels (the SMEAR option above) or by pulling the pixel underneath it towards its color $\mathbf{c}_0$
        The walker has a list of locations in front of it from which it may sample the pixel color. Each walker carries a cost-function $f=f(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{c}_0)$ whose
        value depends on the sensed color $\mathbf{c}$ and its own color $\mathbf{c}_0$. Armed with the cost function, the walker is asked to change its direction
        towards the sensed location with minimal cost. One natural choice of cost-function is $f_{a+}=|\mathbf{c}-\mathbf{c}_0|^2$, which measures the color-space
        distance to its own color $\mathbf{c}_0$. This cost function is the one labelled <i>autophilic</i>. The opposite is a walker that walks towards the color that is
        maximally different from its own color, i.e. $f = f_{a+}$ (<i>autophobic</i>).
