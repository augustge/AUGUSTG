      <h1>Random Tree Generator</h1>
      This is a simple random tree generator made in attempt to study the degrees
      of freedom in the appearance of a tree. I wanted to see what kind of
      branch length, mass splitting and separation angles would generate
      realistic trees.
      In the above, I have assumed the cylindrical branches. If a branch with
      length $L$ and diameter $D$ and direction $\mathbf{d}$ is to split
      into two new branches (subscripted by 1 and 2) I have assumed the following:

      <h3>Bisection matching at branching point</h3>
      Since matrials is carried along the surface of the tree, it seems reasonable
      to match the length of the boundaries to conserve any flux passing though.
      That amounts to saying that
      \[
        D = D_1 + D_2.
      \]
      Therefore, the thickness at a branching point is determined by a random
      variable $f\in[0,1]$ that results in $D_1 = fD$ and $D_2 = (1-f)D$.

      <h3>Branching should respect center of mass</h3>
      If a tree branches too much off to one side, it would tip over. And trees
      that tip over are bad trees. To prevent bad trees, the new branches should
      try not to shift the center of mass in the horizontal direction. Since we
      are considering 2D trees, we can think of the directions $\mathbf{d}$,
      $\mathbf{d}_1$ and $\mathbf{d}_2$ as points on the complex unit circle.
      To keep things simple, let us place the real axis along $\mathbf{d}$ and
      write $\mathbf{d}_1 = e^{i(\theta_0+\delta \theta)}$ and
      $\mathbf{d}_2 = e^{i(\theta_0-\delta \theta)}$. Then, assuming constant
      density, we reach the constraint
      \[
        \Im \left[ M_1 L_1 e^{i\theta_0+i\delta\theta} + M_2 L_2 e^{i\theta_0-i\delta\theta} \right] \simeq 0.
        \implies
        tan(\theta_0)
        =
        \frac{M_2 L_2 - M_1 L_1}{M_2L_2 + M_1 L_1}tan(\delta \theta)
      \]
      Assuming constant density then yields
      \[
        tan(\theta_0)
        =
        \frac{L_2^2 D_2^2 - L_1^2 D_1^2}{L_2^2 D_2^2 + L_1^2 D_1^2}tan(\delta \theta)
      \]

      <h3>A thin branch have shorter length</h3>
      As a branch grows, there is a certain likelihood that the branch will break. As new
      branches form, these will also reduce the sunlight on the branch. Therefore, it is
      reasonable to expect the older parts of the tree to have less branchings. In absence of
      a better model, it seems reasonable to impose some scaling law $L \sim D^\gamma$. Let us,
      for simplicity, assume this to be a clean proportionality. Then we need $\gamma > 0$
      because $L$ has to vanish with $D$, and $\gamma \lesssim 1$ since $L$ should be smaller
      than the $L$ of the previous branch. That is
      \[
        L_n = \left(\frac{D_n}{D}\right)^\gamma L.
      \]

      The result of these three constraints is what can be observed in the animation above. Pressing
      <i>SPACE</i> generates a new tree from a statistical distribution of parameters $(f,\delta \theta, \gamma)$.
