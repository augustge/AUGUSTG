<h1>Basic relations of Fluid Mechanics</h1>

This is a short text about the basic relations and properties of fluids. We will treat a fluid as a field for which the velocity $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of fluid particles relative to some coordinate position $\mathbf{x}$.

Let's start with mass conservation. The produced mass $dM/dt$ inside any volume $V$ must correspond to the flux
out of the volume. That is
\[
  \frac{dM}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\int_V \rho dV = -\int_{\partial V} \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{S}.
\]
Now, keeping the volume fixed, it will be time-independent and thus
\[
   \frac{d}{dt}\int_V \rho dV
   =
   \int_V \partial_t \rho dV.
\]
Our criterion for conservation of mass is therefore

\begin{equation}
  \int_V \partial_t \rho dV + \int_{\partial V} \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{S} = 0.
  \label{eq:MassProduction}
\end{equation}

Invoking Gauss' theorem we can make the two integrals be over the same domain.
\[
  \int_V \left( \partial_t \rho + \nabla \cdot \rho \mathbf{v} \right) dV = 0.
\]
Since this should hold for any choice of volume $V$, evaluation to zero must be due to the vanishing of the integrand. That is
\[
  \partial_t \rho + \nabla \cdot \rho \mathbf{v}  = 0.
\]
This equation is sometimes referred to as the <b>Continuity equation</b>. Note, however, that the volume $V$ may enclose a sink, or a source, in which case the change in mass inside the volume does not correspond to the flux out of the volume. In that case, there will be an additional source-term contributing to the change in mass.
