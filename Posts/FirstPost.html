This is a simple post to test functionality. Does LaTex work?
\[ f(x) \int fdx \]
perhaps also inline? Given $x$, what is $x \mapsto y$ provided $x \in X$?

And now....a simple canvas test:
<div id="sketch-holder"></div>
<script>
  var myp5 = new p5(function (p){
    var t = 0;
    p.setup = function(){
      canvas = p.createCanvas(window.innerWidth/1.5, 300);
      canvas.class("inlineCanvas");
      canvas.parent("sketch-holder");
    }

    p.draw = function(){
      t += 1;
      p.ellipse(10*t%width,7*t%height);
    }
  }, 'sketch-holder');

</script>
