<h1>The Unruh Effect</h1>

<h2>Problems with Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime</h2>

Let us start this discussion by mentioning some of the key problems arising when one tries to construct a Quantum field theory on a curved spacetime. First we let $\{f_i\}$ be a complete set of solutions to the equation of motion arising from some Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$. For the sake of clarity, we will pick the Lagrangian for a free, real scalar field
\[
  \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu \phi \partial^\mu \phi - \frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2.
\]
This is, however, not tensorial. The remedy is to promote partial derivatives $\partial_\mu$ to covariant derivatives $\nabla_\mu$, and include a factor of $\sqrt{-g}$, where $-g$ is the absolute value of the determinant of the metric, to make $\mathcal{L}$ an honest, tensorial scalar density. In addition, we will add some interaction term between the curvature scalar $R$ and the field, toggled by a parameter $\xi$:
\[
  \mathcal{L} = \sqrt{-g}\left( \frac{1}{2}\nabla_\mu \phi \nabla^\mu \phi - \frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2 - \xi R \phi^2\right).
\]


We will consider a non-interacting scalar field propagating on a flat spacetime. We let the field satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation and remind the reader that quantization involves promoting the fourier coefficients of the field to creation and annihilation operators. Recall also that in this setting, the vacuum state is exactly the state that is killed by all annihilation operators. Creation operators are those corresponding to the negative frequency modes $e^{ik_0 t}$, and annihilation operators correspond to negative frequency modes $e^{-ik_0 t}$ for $k_0>0$.
Let us consider a (D+1)-dimensional spacetime whose metric is
\[
  dS^2 = N^2(x)dt^2 - G_{ab}dx^a dx^b.
\]
From minimal coupling, we find the Klein-Gordon equation to be of the form
\[
  (\nabla_\mu \nabla^\mu + m^2)\phi = 0
\]
arising from the Lagrangian density
\[
  \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{-g}
  \left( \nabla_\mu \phi \nabla^\mu \phi - m^2 \phi^2 \right).
\]
The KG equation can be separated:
\[
  \partial_t (N^{-1}\sqrt{G}\partial_t \phi)-\partial_a (N\sqrt{G}G^{ab} \partial_b \phi) + N \sqrt{G}m^2 \phi = 0.
\]
If $f_A(x)$ and $f_B(x)$ solves this equation, then
\[
  J^\mu_{(f_A,f_B)}(x) \equiv f^*_A(x)\nabla^\mu f_B(x) - f_B(x)\nabla^\mu f^*_A(x)
\]
is the covariantly conserved KG current. That is,
\[
  (f_A,f_B)_{KG} \equiv i\int d^Dx \sqrt{G}n_\mu J^\mu_{(f_A,f_B)}(x)
\]
is a time-independent quantity provided $n_\mu$ is a future-directed unit vector normal to the surface of constant time. Let us refer to this quantity as the KG inner product of $f_A$ and $f_B$. Note that for our choice of metric, the KG inner product takes the form
\[
  (f_A,f_B)_{KG} = i\int d^Dx \sqrt{G} N^{-1}(f^*_A\partial_t f_B - f_B \partial_t f^*_A).
\]
The conjugate momentum density $\pi(x)$ can be found as follows
\[
  \pi(x) \equiv \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial_t \phi)} = N^{-1}\sqrt{G} \partial_t \phi.
\]
This means that if $p_A$ is the conjugate momentum density of a solution $f_A$, then
\[
  (f_A,f_B)_{KG} = i\int d^Dx (f^*_A p_B - p_A^* f_B).
\]
Now, to quantize, we impose the canonical (equal-time) commutation relations stating that $\phi$ and $\pi$ always commute with themselves and
\[
  [\phi(t,x),\pi(t,x')] = i\delta^D(x,x').
\]
It is nice to note that
\[
  [(f_A,\phi)_{KG},(\phi,f_B)_{KG}] = (f_A,f_B)_{KG}.
\]
Now, let $\{f_i,f_i^*\}$ be a complete set of solutions and assume we can make this set satisfy
\[
  (f_i,f_j)_{KG} = -(f_i^*,f_j^*)_{KG} = \delta_{ij}
  \text{ and }
  (f^*_i,f_j)_{KG} = (f_i,f_j^*)_{KG} = 0.
\]
We will stick to discrete indexing knowing that the arguments that will be presented are easily extended to the continuous case. Let us pick the $f_i$'s to be the positive-frequency solutions so that
\[
  \phi(x) = \sum_i \left( \hat{a}_i f_i(x) + \hat{a}^\dagger_i f^*_i \right)
\]
which gives $(f_i,\phi)_{KG}=\hat{a}_i$ and $(\phi,f_i)_{KG}=\hat{a}^\dagger_i$.
It follows that creations and annihilations commute with themselves and that $[\hat{a}_i,\hat{a}^\dagger_j]=\delta_{ij}$ (this is equivalent to the canoncial commutation relations).
Now, equipped with a vacuum state $|0\rangle$ defined by $\hat{a}_i |0\rangle = 0$ for all $i$, we can populated the Fock space of states by applying creation operators on the vacuum $|0\rangle$. Notice that the choice of functions $f_i$ determines the vacuum state. Therefore, let us consider two different such choices $\{f_i^{(1)}\}$ and $\{f_I^{(2)}\}$. These sets being complete means that we can write
\[
  f_I^{(2)} = \sum_i \left( \alpha_{Ii}f_i^{(1)}+\beta_{Ii}f_i^{(1)*} \right)
  \text{ and }
  f_I^{(2)*} = \sum_i \left( \alpha_{Ii}^*f_i^{(1)*}+\beta_{Ii}^*f_i^{(1)} \right)
\]
where one can show that
\[
  \alpha_{Ii} = (f_i^{(1)},f_I^{(2)})_{KG} = (f_I^{(2)},f_i^{(1)})_{KG}^*
  \text{ and }
  \beta_{Ii} = -(f_i^{(1)*},f_I^{(2)})_{KG} = (f_I^{(2)*},f_i^{(1)})_{KG}
\]
this means that we can also express $\{f_i^{(1)}\}$ in terms of $\{f_I^{(2)}\}$ by
\[
  f_i^{(1)} = \sum_i \left( \alpha_{Ii}^*f_I^{(2)}-\beta_{Ii}f_I^{(2)*} \right)
  \text{ and }
  f_i^{(1)*} = \sum_i \left( \alpha_{Ii}f_I^{(2)*}-\beta_{Ii}^*f_I^{(2)*} \right)
\]
and, of course, $phi$ can be expanded in both sets
\[
  \hat{\phi}(x)
  = \sum_i
  \left( \hat{a}_i^{(1)}f_i^{(1)}+\hat{a}_i^{(1)\dagger}f_i^{(1)} \right)
  = \sum_I
  \left( \hat{a}_I^{(2)}f_I^{(2)}+\hat{a}_I^{(2)\dagger}f_I^{(2)} \right).
\]
Comparing the coefficients after using the expressions for $f_i^{(1)}$ in terms of $f_I^{(2)}$ and vice versa, we find
\[
  \hat{a}_i^{(1)} = \sum_I \left(\alpha_{Ii}\hat{a}_I^{(2)}+\beta^*_{Ii}\hat{a}_I^{(2)\dagger} \right)
  \text{ and }
  \hat{a}_I^{(2)} = \sum_i \left(\alpha_{Ii}^*\hat{a}_i^{(1)}-\beta^*_{Ii}\hat{a}_i^{(1)\dagger} \right)
\]
This transformation is referred to as a <i>Bogoliubov transformation</i> and the coefficients $\alpha_{Ii}$ and $\beta_{Ii}$ as Bogoliubov coefficients. Crucially, if $\beta_{Ii}$ does not vanish for all $I$ and $i$, the two vacuum states $|0\rangle_{(1)}$ and $|0\rangle_{(2)}$ will be distinct. For example, consider the number operator $\hat{N}_i^{(1)}=\hat{a}_i^{(1)\dagger}\hat{a}_i^{(1)}$ counting $(1)$ particles in mode $i$. By definition, we have $\hat{N}_i^{(1)} |0\rangle_{(1)}$, but
\[
  _{(2)}\langle 0 | \hat{N}_i^{(1)} | 0 \rangle_{(2)}
  = \sum_I |\beta_{Ii}|^2.
\]
Similarly, for $\hat{N}_I^{(2)}$ we have
\[
  _{(1)}\langle 0 | \hat{N}_I^{(2)} | 0 \rangle_{(1)}
  = \sum_i |\beta_{Ii}|^2.
\]
Now, there is a natural vacuum state in a static spacetime ($N$ and $G$ being time-independent). One would then choose $f_i$ to correspond to $e^{i\omega_i t}$, where $\omega_i$ is the energy of the particle wrt the future-directed killing vector $\partial_t$. We call this state the <i>static vacuum</i>. In a Minkowski spacetime, there are global timelike Killing vector fields, generating time-translations in various inertial frames. All these Killing vector fields define the same vacuum state.
