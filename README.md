### Thoughts and other stuff


## About this page 
This page is a playground for web-programming. 
I aim to populate the page, which is found at augustge.github.io, with small texts, animations and thoughs
about things I find interesting. Note, however, that this is also more like a playground than an actual 
set of well-prepared and worked-out content. I make these animations and texts when I want to see if I know something,
and if I can do it by myself.
